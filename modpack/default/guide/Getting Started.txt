So you've done the basics: you've cut down a tree, gotten some wood, and made your crafting table. One of the first things you may notice is a warning that appears when you craft a wooden pickaxe:

In this pack, wooden and stone tools are nerfed down to 64 durability. Gold, diamond, and iron tools are nerfed even further - they only have 1 durability!

To avoid this, you'll need to use tools from mods instead. But for now, a wooden pickaxe is fine to use to get some cobblestone and make a stone pickaxe. If you'd like, you can also use Tinkers' Construct to make a flint pickaxe. See the guide book you spawned with, §oMaterials and You: Volume 1§r, to learn how to do this. If you don't have it, you can look up its crafting recipe in NEI (see the page on Not Enough Items in this guide for more information). Note that in this pack, flint won't randomly drop from breaking gravel. You can put 3 gravel into your crafting grid to get 1 flint. To make a flint pickaxe, you do not need to make the entire pickaxe out of flint; only the pickaxe head needs to be made out of flint. An example is shown below.

§oUse the Stencil Table to make patterns for a Pickaxe Head, Tool Rod, and Tool Binding. Use those patterns in the Part Builder to make each part, and make sure that the pickaxe head is flint. In the Tool Station, click the button on the left to make a pickaxe and put each tool part in the corresponding slot.§r

Whether you made a stone pickaxe or flint pickaxe, they both have a mining level of Iron. This means that they can mine ores like coal, copper, tin, and iron. Go down and mine some ores!

As stated above, vanilla pickaxes made out of iron, gold, and diamond are almost useless since they only have 1 durability. Thus, at this point, you will be forced to move to other tools. Make a bronze pickaxe - the best option you have is to use Tinkers' Construct to make one. You'll need to make a Smeltery first to make a pickaxe head out of a metal. See the guides you have (or craft them if you don't), §oMaterials and You: Volume 1§r, as well as §oMighty Smelting§r to learn how to do this.

To make bronze, you'll need to make an alloy out of (3) copper and (1) tin. The best and most efficient early-game way to do this is to use a Smeltery, as mentioned before. Additionally, the Smeltery will also double the output you get from ores, so you can get 2 ingots worth of material from every ore! Below are some examples of valid Smeltery arrangements.

§oProtip: If you find a village, they typically contain many of the materials you need for a Smeltery!§r

To power your Smeltery, you'll need to get some lava. Make a Bucket (or Fired Clay Bucket) to transport the lava and put it in your Smeltery's Seared Tank.
