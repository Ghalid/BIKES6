Here are some random tips and tricks that may help you:
- Press F9 (default) to show chunk boundaries.
- You can press T (default) while hovering over an item to find it in nearby inventories (such as chests).
- In the Tinkers' Construct smeltery, you can use Blazing Pyrotheum to power it instead of lava, and it works much faster.
- When you get to the point in the game with a lot of autocrafting, take the time to learn how to setup Applied Energistics 2's autocrafting.
- You probably shouldn't bother trying to grow Magical Crops until you get far into the pack's magical themed mods.
